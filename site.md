To make any changes to the theme/website, one has to login to the wordpress admin panel for http://3.25.129.239/.
Once logged in, the user can update current pages, add new ones and modify the content. An admin can give the user privilages. This helps better secure and manage the website. Administrator has full read and write access to control every aspect which wordpress provides. In our group work Davide was the admin and he created two user accounts. I was given editor access. I was limited to creating new posts and pages. This helped me to focus on collaborating with team members via whatzapp and slack to create content for our pages. We used AWS to create a staging environment which included most our files. Once the website is launched we would have to give our client a link. He would use this link to login into the backend of the website so he can create posts/articles. He does not need to access to setting and plugins and giving him jsut what he requires makes it easier for him to manage the website. 

This website includes important plugins which needs to be updated when the user is notified. TinyMCE is a text editor which expands fucntions to the current editor. This is really helpul if the client needs to create a table or change the font size which out having to use hypertext. 

Loginizer plugin - this is a helpful plugin to limit the number of login attempts. It protects the site from dicitonary or brutal force attacks.

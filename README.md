This repository contains code for the website developed by Nishant, Davide and Inderjot for CP3402 assessment. It includes the code for the theme and the final website from Wordpress and the videos of our stand-up meetings. 

The folder named ourWebsite contains all the relevant files. The following files are what we have updated: index.php - this is our home page
header.php - we added a logo image file using html and gave it an ID called header_logo. The memu was added in this file as well using html and unordered lists. This was linked to its respective pages in the database. 
footer.php - This was a very simple file to create as we only included the copywrite text. 
sidebar.php - This page includes the Wordpress sidebar post widge. We used this as it helped use make the text more compact and readable.
